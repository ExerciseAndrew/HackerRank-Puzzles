# HackerRank-Puzzles
Trying to get better at this-

Here is another puzzle repository. Not sure why I am switching from codewars to hackerrank.
I think I was just curious about what the difference would be. Also, switching to hackerrank
gives me the chance to run through beginner stuff before the difficulty gets too advanced for my
self-esteem and starts to affect my study morale.
